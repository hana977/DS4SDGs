Data Distributions, Feature Importance, and Multicollinearity

This repository contains two assignments that involve feature importance, multicollinearity, and data distributions using synthetic data. The tasks are based on the Titanic dataset and various data distribution techniques.

Assignment 1: Feature Importance & Multicollinearity
Objective:

Implement a feature importance method different from the ones already experimented with in class.

Check for multicollinearity and covariance in the Titanic dataset.

Approach:

Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature importance.

Visualized the correlation matrix to detect multicollinearity and covariance among features.

Assignment 2: Data Distributions & Visualization
Objective:

Work with at least five different types of data distributions.

Visualize them using synthetic data.

Approach:

Generated synthetic data for five different types of distributions: Normal, Uniform, Exponential, Binomial, and Poisson.

Visualized these distributions using seaborn and matplotlib.
